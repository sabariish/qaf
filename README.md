<h3>Powerful Automation Platform for Test Authoring, Test Execution and Execution Analysis</h3>

QMetry Automation Framework provides a powerful and versatile platform to author Test Cases in Behavior Driven, Keyword Driven or Code Driven approach. It helps to significantly reduce costs involved in setting up Test Automation at any organization. It is a right tool for Web Platform, Mobile Platform (Native, Mobile Web, HTML5,etc) and Web Service test automation solution using Selenium and other related technologies. QMetry Automation Framework benefits any QA Team in developing highly maintainable and repeatable tests that utilize reusable test assets, proper modularity and semantic structure. Descriptive Reporting satisfies high-level as well as low-level (debugging) aspects.
<p>
		QMetry Automation Framework is designed to solve common industry
		problems related to testing complex web systems. The framework is best
		suited for writing Automated Web, Mobile Web and Mobile Native
		Application UI Tests simulate real user activities on the page. <br />

		The framework is built upon java and integrates TestNG,
		Selenium/Webdriver, Appium and Perfecto. Due to the framework's
		thorough design, test developer does not need to worry about common
		tasks such as thread safe browser session for running test in
		parallel, reporting or to incorporate result with test management
		tools. The tests run can be configured through standard testing
		configuration files, the test run filters and behavior can be changed
		within the config File. <br /> The architecture of the framework
		ensures a low cost of maintenance while supporting extensibility by:
</p>
<ul>
		<li>Abstracting the technical implementation away from the
			operational components</li>
		<li>Following accepted design patterns in creating the core
			functionalities within the framework.</li>
		<li>Providing an approach to develop highly maintainable and
			repeatable tests that utilize reusable test assets, proper modularity
			and semantic structure. Framework has readymade services for
			assertions, browser, reporting and data. Also, framework concept is
			based on page services so your page and related actions will be
			reusable from any test case. There is a good logging functionality
			and screen shot facility for assertions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
	QMetry Automation Framework supports integrations with Test Management
	Platform (QMetry, Rally, ApTest, HP ALM, etc), Continuous Integration
	Systems (Jenkins, Bamboo, etc), Mobile Device Cloud Solutions
	(SauceLabs, Perfecto Mobile, etc).

<h3>QMetry Automation Framework Key Features</h3>
